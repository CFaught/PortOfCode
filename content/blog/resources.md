This book is a definitive guide for learning mobile development in Javascript using the React Native framework.

* [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](http://amzn.to/2zn5oU0) - This is probably the most well known Ruby on Rails book out there.

> These books are a few of the ones I liked alot. I enjoy having a physical book in front of me, but some of these also have a free web-based version like [Chris Pine's Book](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/), and the [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book)
