# Anyone Can Learn to Code

I believe that a lot of people approach the idea of programming with a bias built up from hearing about guys from MIT and Harvard starting revolutionary projects causing people to think that programmers need to be math majors or engineers to become competent at developing applications. And while it's true that there are a lot of super smart people in the community, there are also just as many average Joe's out there with good ideas that are able to pick up programming and build great things.

There are a couple of factors that allow for this:
* Abstraction - Programmers stand on the shoulders of those that went before them and developed the tools that abstract away the things that programmers do on a regular basis. This hides the nitty-gritty of things like machine code, compiling, and garbage collection. More on this later.

* Great resources - There are tons of great resources (like this site hopefully) online now that help beginners understand the fundamentals and guide them towards the right topics to accomplish specific tasks. These resources include forums like [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), communities within specific technologies, and documentation.
