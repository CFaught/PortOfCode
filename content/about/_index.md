## Hello, my name is Caleb Faught!
I am a professional developer who works mainly with Javascript and SQL in developing small business intelligence applications for public services departments. I currently live in Denton, TX with my beautiful wife and son. I grew up on the Gulf-Coast of Texas where I learned to sail, fish, surf, and dive. I am a graduate of [Flatiron's Learn.co](https://flatironschool.com/online-campus/) online bootcamp where I study Ruby/Rails, HTML5/CSS3, and Javascript. I also am a proud graduate of Texas A&M University where I studied Ocean Engineering and learned the basics of programming with Matlab and Python while working on engineering projects. I enjoy web and mobile development, but also love tinkering with embedded systems using the Arduino and Raspberry Pi platforms.
I have used a lot of free and paid resources on the internet to get to where I am today and
Port of Code is my attempt at giving back to the software development community. I aim to continue developing my skills and help new developers along the way.

My name is Caleb Faught, I currently live in Denton, TX with my beautiful wife Christina. I grew up on the Gulf-Coast of Texas where I learned to sail, fish, surf, and dive. I am a student at Flatiron's Learn.co online bootcamp where I study Ruby/Rails, HTML5/CSS3, and Javascript. Before Flatiron, I spent some time learning C and Python. I enjoy web and mobile development, but also love tinkering with embedded systems using the Arduino and Raspberry Pi platforms. Having studied Ocean Engineering in college I would like to someday write software that would be beneficial to ocean studies, but for now I am content with just honing my skills as a budding developer. -->
