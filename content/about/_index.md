## Hello, my name is Caleb Faught!
I am a self taught developer and used a lot of free and paid resources on the internet to get to where I am today.
Port of Code is my attempt at giving back to the software development community, and help new developers on their path to professional developers.


Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/CFaught/PortOfCode/issues/new) or [ask me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/cfaught12).

Thanks for stopping by!
